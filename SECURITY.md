Security Policy
***
If an end-user discovers a vulnerability in the update_full-unix script, it can be reported in the Private Vulnerability Reporting:
< https://github.com/mportizlunyov/update_full-unix/security/advisories >

Please do not send any security notifications regarding any of package managers used, since I cannot control anything of any package manager.
Make sure that the security vulnerabilities are about the script itself.
