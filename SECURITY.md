# Security Policy
If an end-user discovers a vulnerability in the update_full-bash script, it can be reported to:
< tangier_commiters@simplelogin.com >

When disclosing a security vulnerability, please write everything into the text of the email.
I WILL NOT LOOK AT EMAILS WITH ATTACHMENTS!
Please do not send any security notifications regarding any of package managers used.
I cannot control anything of any package manager.
Make sure that the security vulnerabilities are about the script itself.
